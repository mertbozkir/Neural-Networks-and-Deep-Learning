# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this course. All the code base, quiz questions.
[Neural Networks and Deep Learning on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning).

## Who Am I

As a 1th CS student and a short-time self-taught learner, I have completed plenty CS related MOOCs on Udemy.
I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program.
There are discussion forums on most MOOC platforms, however, even a question with detailed description may need some time to be answered. 
Here I released these solutions, which are **only for your reference purpose**. It may help you to save some time. 
And I hope you don't copy any part of the code (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully), see the quiz solutions before you start your own adventure. 
This course is almost the simplest deep learning course I have ever taken, but the simplicity is based on the fabulous course content and structure. 
It's a treasure given by deeplearning.ai team.

Currently, this repo has  parts you may be interested in and I will give a list here.

## Quiz Solutions

There are concerns that some people may use the content here to quickly ace the course so I'll no longer update any quiz solution.
